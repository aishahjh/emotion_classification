# Emotion Classification
A Deep Learning Approach For Emotion Classification In Textual Data


### Overview
This repository contains code and resources for multi-label emotion classification using deep learning models. The project focuses on leveraging transformer-based models like RoBERTa and DistilBERT, along with ensemble techniques, to predict multiple emotions associated with textual data.

### Dataset Information
- The data folder contain the GoEmotions train, validation and test split from (https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions)
- The clean subfolder contain the pre-processed dataset
- The augmented subfolder contain the generated augmented data

### Model Information
- The RoBERTa folder comprises notebooks detailing the experimentation on various RoBERTa models, along with their corresponding results.
- The DistilBERT folder comprises notebooks detailing the experimentation on various DistilBERT models, along with their corresponding results.
- The Ensemble folder comprises notebooks about ensemble experimnetations along with their corresponding results.
